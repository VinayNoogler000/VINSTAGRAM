## 📖 Overview

Vinstagram is a social media platform, where users can create, view, edit and delete their posts, where each post consists of an image and a caption. 
This project is built completely by the intent of learning and strengthening my web development skills, especially Backend development, and later scaling it to a Full-Stack Web App by integrating DB and more features to it. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of building a web application by using these backend web technologies.

## 🎥 Demo

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the server and handle routing.
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A templating engine used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **Vanilla CSS**: For styling the HTML content.
- **UUID**: A library to generate unique identifiers for each post.
- **Vanilla CSS**: For styling the HTML content.
- **Multer**: A middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, used for uploading files.
- **Method-Override**: A library to use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client doesn't support it.

## 📚 Learnings

1. **Node.js**: Gained an understanding of how to use Node.js to build server-side applications.
2. **Express.js**: Learned how to use Express.js to create a web server and handle routing.
3. **EJS**: Learned how to use EJS as a templating engine to generate dynamic HTML content.
4. **REST Principles**: Acquired knowledge of REST principles for creating RESTful APIs.
5. **CRUD Operations**: Understood the concepts of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
6. **CRUD on Resources**: Learned to perform CRUD operations on resources (data stored in the database) using HTTP verbs and RESTful APIs.
7. **Redirection**: Learned to redirect client requests using `res.redirect()` in route handlers.
8. **Method Override**: Learned to override HTTP GET and POST methods with PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods using the `method-override` library.
9. **Route/Path vs API**: Understood the difference between a route/path and an API. A route/path is an endpoint to handle requests, while an API is a set of rules for communication between client and server.
10. **Multer Library**: Learned how to use the `multer` library for handling file uploads, including specifying the destination and name of the uploaded files, defining the total number of files the client can send with requests or form-data, parsing the image files uploaded as form-data, and handling multiple file uploads of the same field.
11. **Dotenv**: Learned how to use the `dotenv` library to manage environment variables, allowing for better configuration and security of sensitive information.

## 🗓️ What My Daily Life Looks Like?
As of now (latest version of this README file), I'm building Projects using Web Development technologies to strengthen my fundamentals, in both Frontend & Backend, thriving to become a skilled Full-Stack Web Developer.

This project/website is my 1st self-made Backend project (as the genuine 1st project was Quora clone, made with the help of my teacher).

I'm currently learning Full-Stack Web Development (90% already completed) while developing a Full-Stack "AirBnb Clone" project, with the help of [Apna College Institute's](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apna-college/posts/?feedView=all) Delta Course.

After this, I will be building atleast 3-5 major Projects using React.js framework with Redux.js library, then building at least 3 real-world Full-Stack (MERN) projects to hone my skills, and secure a Full-Stack Web Developer job.
